This Python script involves building a bioinformatics pipeline script to retrieve, annotate, and analyse viral genomic sequences from the NCBI Virus Genome database.

In simpler words, it's a Google search for virus DNA/RNA, but for scientists.

- You give it a virus ID (from the NCBI database).
- It looks up that virus’s complete genome sequence from NCBI.
- It creates a file with all the gene annotations — basically a list of important parts in the virus genome and what they do.
